# Soil_Moisture_Prediction_using-Machine-Learning

Overview
Soil moisture prediction is crucial for modern agriculture, directly impacting crop yield and water resource management. This project aims to predict soil moisture levels using machine learning models, enabling farmers and agronomists to optimize irrigation and make informed decisions related to crop planning, planting, and harvesting.

By leveraging predictive models, this project forecasts soil moisture levels under different environmental conditions, ensuring efficient water use and enhancing agricultural productivity.

Dataset
This project uses soil and environmental datasets that include:

Soil Data: Soil texture, organic matter content, moisture levels.
Environmental Data: Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and evapotranspiration records.
Target: Soil moisture levels categorized into three key states:
Saturation: Soil pores are filled with water.
Field Capacity: Ideal moisture for plant growth.
Wilting Point: No water available for plants.
Data Sources
Publicly available meteorological and soil datasets from governmental or research institutions.
Custom datasets collected using soil moisture sensors (if applicable).

Usage
1. Prepare the Data
Ensure your dataset includes soil properties and environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, etc.
Data should be formatted as a CSV file.
2. Train the Model
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --data <path_to_your_dataset.csv>
This command will train the machine learning model using the provided dataset.

3. Predict Soil Moisture
After the model has been trained, you can predict soil moisture using new environmental data:


Model Training
The model can be trained using algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks.
Parameters for the model can be adjusted in the config.json file or passed via command-line arguments.
The project uses cross-validation and grid search to optimize hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
You can visualize the performance of the model using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.
