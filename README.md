# Soil Moisture Prediction

## Overview

Soil moisture prediction is crucial for modern agriculture, directly impacting crop yield and water resource management. This project aims to predict soil moisture levels using machine learning models, enabling farmers and agronomists to optimize irrigation and make informed decisions related to crop planning, planting, and harvesting.

By leveraging predictive models, this project forecasts soil moisture levels under different environmental conditions, ensuring efficient water use and enhancing agricultural productivity.
